# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using JavaScript. In this game, the player competes against the computer by choosing one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner of each round is determined based on the rules of the game: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.

## Features

- **Player vs. Computer:** Play against the computer and see who wins more rounds.
- **Score Display:** Keep track of the score with a visual representation of each player's wins.
- **Round Results:** See the outcome of each round displayed on the screen.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I delved into several key concepts of JavaScript:

- **Functions:** I gained a deeper understanding of how functions work, including how to define them and how to invoke them.
- **Scope:** I learned about variable scope and how it affects the accessibility of variables within different parts of the code.
- **Nested Conditions:** I explored the use of nested conditional statements to handle different game outcomes based on player and computer choices.
- **DOM Manipulation:** I acquired basic skills in using the Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with HTML elements and update their content dynamically.

## Usage

To play the game, simply click on one of the buttons representing your choice: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will randomly select its choice, and the outcome of each round will be displayed on the screen. The first player to reach 5 wins will be declared the overall winner.
